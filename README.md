# **Battle Garegga quality of life patches.**

Program rom patches for Battle Garegga that add some convenience and functionality:

 - Mahou guest characters unlocked.
 - ABC ship type selectable via start button
 - Selectable autofire rate: Start+B raises autofire rate (8hz, 10hz, 12hz, 15hz, 20hz, 30hz). You cannot decrease the autofire rate.
 - No rank carry over between credits. Rank starts at power on default
   every credit.
 - Item drop order reset to initial value every credit
 - Item non collected counts reset to initial values every credit
 - Quick reset: start+ABC resets to the copyright screen
 - Scoreboard display bug fixed. Top scores will show the proper letter
   instead of punctuation for 10M+
 - Autofire rate display. Bottom left and right display current autofire
   rate for respective player.
 - Rank display. Real time display of current game rank.
 - Rank change display: Per-frame display of rank change during the
   frame. This excludes per-frame rank adjustments and any rank changes
   due to shooting (normal and option).
 - Rank percentage display. Should line up with the rank percentage in
   the M2 port.
 - Per frame rank display.

Rank and rank change are shown in hexadecimal. Per frame is shown in decimal. This is because the M2 port shows the per-frame rank in decimal too; I wanted them to match up for less (personal) confusion.

## How to use
